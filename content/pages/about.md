I’m an entrepreneur, product builder, and AI enthusiast, passionate about how AI agents are transforming the way we work and live. After years in the tech industry—most recently leading the development of an AI agent with federated search to help enterprises untangle vast databases—I’ve taken the leap to start my own business. My focus is on harnessing and managing multiple AI agents, developed by diverse tech companies and independent creators, to supercharge productivity and streamline workflows. I truly believe we’re at the dawn of an AI revolution, and I’m excited to be part of shaping what comes next.

## Exploring the Power of AI Collaboration

I’m a founder of [Epismo](https://about.epismo.ai/en), a platform that enables seamless collaboration between humans and AI agents. This innovative approach allows teams to divide tasks effectively, optimize workflows, and enhance productivity by leveraging multiple specialized AI agents. The platform also features a knowledge timeline, centralizing team information and improving knowledge management. I’m eager to integrate these advancements into my work, driving more efficient and dynamic collaborations.

## My Background in AI and Data Science

My background is in computational science, with expertise in optimization algorithms, artificial intelligence, and data-driven decision-making. I’ve worked on a variety of AI-driven solutions, from search engines to demand prediction. One of my proudest achievements is developing a deep-learning model for estimating brain injuries, which earned me the best master’s thesis award. Additionally, I gained hands-on experience in software engineering, including developing charging controllers for electric vehicles during an internship in Germany.

## Passion for Global Inspiration

Beyond technology, I thrive on product design and transforming complex ideas into practical solutions. My experience working with global teams across diverse cultures has sharpened my ability to communicate effectively and collaborate across different perspectives. I have a deep passion for traveling and immersing myself in different cultures. Exploring new places and perspectives fuels my creativity and inspires my work. My goal is to work from various locations around the world, drawing insights from diverse environments and integrating them into AI-driven innovations.

As I navigate this new chapter, I’m excited about the limitless possibilities of AI and the future we’re building together. Let’s shape the future, one AI agent at a time!
