I’m an entrepreneur and product builder focused on helping teams collaborate effectively with multiple AI agents. My work is centered on the foundations agents need to operate well in real environments, so teams can rely on them for everyday workflows and real productivity. I believe we’re at the beginning of a major shift in how work gets done, and I’m excited to help shape what comes next.
