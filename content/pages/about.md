As a product manager in the tech industry at a startup, I am dedicated to empowering businesses and individuals with data.
Currently, I am leading the development of a modern data platform that enables seamless data utilization faster than ever.

My educational background in computational science, particularly in optimization algorithms and artificial intelligence, has provided me with a strong foundation in designing and developing a range of data-driven solutions from search engines to demand prediction.
I am particularly proud of my work on estimating brain injuries by data assimilation and deep learning, which earned me the best master’s thesis award.
During my master’s program, I also gained valuable software engineering experience as an intern in Germany, where I developed and evaluated charging controllers for electric vehicles.

I excel at product design and communication with a solid understanding of technical concepts.
My experience working with international teams in diverse environments has honed my cross-cultural competencies, making me well-equipped to thrive in any global arena.

I am always on the lookout for stimulating new challenges and am willing to relocate anywhere in the world to pursue them.
