Platform engineering is an emerging technology approach that not only propels the rapid delivery of applications but also amplifies their impact on business value.
Going beyond conventional software engineering, it concentrates on establishing internal platforms to streamline development processes.
This article explores the successful integration of data mesh principles, revealing how this powerful combination empowers diverse teams.
It also emphazises the pivotal role of product management in platform engineering, illustrating how organizations can navigate challenges, meet user needs effectively and unlock the full potential of platform engineering by embracing tailored product management techniques for internal platforms.

## Data mesh and its impact

A data mesh represents a paradigm shift in data architecture, emphasizing four key principles: 1) domain-oriented decentralized data ownership and architecture, 2) data as a product, 3) self-serve data infrastructure as a platform, and 4) federated computational governance.
By applying these principles, our organization experienced a transformative impact on platform engineering.

### Empowering decentralized development

A data mesh encourages a decentralized approach, allowing individual teams to own and develop their data domains independently so that they can achieve their business requirements effectively.
This autonomy also fosters a sense of ownership and accountability among teams, promoting innovation and creativity.

### Navigating the tech stack strategically

While data mesh grants teams the freedom to choose their development paths, the organization maintains control over the tech stack.
This strategic decision ensures coherence across the platform, facilitates interoperability, and maximizes knowledge-sharing opportunities.

### Leveraging knowledge for collaborative growth

Despite the autonomy given to teams, the organization actively leverages its collective knowledge to foster collaboration and cross-pollination of ideas.
This unique blend of autonomy and collective wisdom ensures a balance between innovation, reliability, and scalability, contributing to the long-term success of the platform.

## Unique challenges as a product manager

In the intricate realm of platform engineering, product management is not as a luxury but as a vital necessity.
Unlike external products, internal platforms require a different approach to meet the needs of diverse teams within an organization.

Platform products serve as the cornerstone for other teams, making it imperative for product managers to grasp the intricacies of varied user needs and expectations.
Navigating challenges such as various requirements, technical debt, and avoiding vendor lock-in becomes paramount for ensuring the success of the platformâ€”an emblematic challenge in the realm of product management, whether for external or internal products.

### Applying product management techniques

To excel in platform engineering, product managers must leverage proven product management techniques.
Conducting thorough user research becomes the linchpin, aiding in understanding the pain points and desires of internal users.
Crafting a compelling value proposition ensures that the platform seamlessly aligns with organizational goals, reflecting the strategic acumen inherent in effective product management.
Here's the best practices for product management in platform engineering:

-   **User involvement**: Actively involve internal users in the development process to gather real-world insights and enhance user satisfaction.
-   **Communication**: Clearly communicate the vision and value of the platform to all stakeholders, fostering understanding and support.
-   **Alignment with business objectives**: Ensure that platform goals align with broader business objectives, fostering synergy between technology and business strategies.

Roadmapping is crucial in the iterative development of the platform, allowing teams to prioritize features based on user needs and business objectives. Feedback loops should be established, fostering continuous improvement and adaptability to evolving requirements.

### Measuring success and impact

It is important to share concrete results and outcomes achieved through successful product management in platform engineering. Demonstrating instances where developer satisfaction increased, time-to-market decreased, and overall customer experience improved becomes pivotal.
Product managers play a pivotal role in measuring the success and impact of platform engineering initiatives.
Few examples of metrics for evaluation are the following:

-   **Developer satisfaction**: Gauge the satisfaction levels of internal users, ensuring that the platform meets their needs efficiently.
-   **Time-to-market**: Measure the reduction in time-to-market for applications built on the platform, showcasing increased development speed.
-   **Customer experience**: Evaluate the impact on the end-user experience, as a robust internal platform often translates to improved external product quality.

In conclusion, the integration of data mesh principles into our platform engineering approach stands as a testament to the achieved success through a harmonious balance between autonomy and strategic guidance, fostering innovative and collaborative growth.
Moreover, wholeheartedly embracing product management techniques tailored for internal platforms empowers organizations to adeptly navigate challenges, meet user needs effectively and unlock the full potential of platform engineering.
If your platform engineering team currently lacks dedicated product managers, exploring this avenue or enabling someone from the engineering team to acquire product management skills can be a transformative step.
